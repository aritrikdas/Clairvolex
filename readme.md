# Book Search API and React App

## Overview

This repository is structured as a monorepo containing both the backend API and the frontend React application.

### Project Structure

- **Backend (Book Search API)**: Located in the `backend` folder.
- **Frontend (React App)**: Located in the `ui` folder.

## Demo

A live demo of the application is available at: [https://clairvolex.onrender.com/](https://clairvolex.onrender.com/)

**Note**: The server is hosted on a free tier, which incurs a cold start time of approximately 50 seconds.

## Backend (Book Search API)

The Book Search API allows users to search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, published date range, genre, and availability. 

### Endpoints

- **/books**: Supports `GET` and `POST` requests to retrieve a list of books based on search criteria.

### Search Criteria

- **Title**: Partial or full match.
- **Author**: Partial or full match.
- **Published Date Range**: Optional.
- **Genre**: Optional.
- **Sort Order**: By title, author, or publication date.
- **Pagination**: Page number and size.
- **Availability**: Filter by in-stock books only.

### Implementation Details

- All business logic is implemented within the route files due to time constraints.
- JWT authorization is not included but can be implemented using middleware.
- Database: MySQL
- ORM: Objection.js
- Migrations and seed data: Knex.js

### Running the Backend
